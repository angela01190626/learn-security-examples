Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

When the user logs in, there is a cookie. Someone can copy the cookie and log in as a malicious user.
But the secure version have httpOnly set to be true to prevent client from accessing the cookie, 
and sameSite set to be true to only allow cookies to be sent in a first-party context.

Spoofing violates availability.
